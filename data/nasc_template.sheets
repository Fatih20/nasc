My first sheet-§-|§§|Tutorial-§-Thank you for using NaSC!\nThis is an early version, so you probably encounter bugs.\nIn NaSC you can put text and math side by side\nand the answer will be shown on the right pane.\n11 + 31\nYou can plug those answers in future equations\nsin line5° + cos line5rad\nand if a answer changes, so does the equation its used in.\n\nThe last answer can be referenced with the keyword ans\nor a specific line with lineX\n\nYou can define your own variables:\na = 5\n22 + a\nYou can get answers in various units:\n14 cm * 3 cm\nand convert between these units:\nline17 to in²\nor convert between currencies:\n100€ to $\n\nYou can also play with time or print the week of the year\n3days + 4hour + 4years to ms\nweek(12.12.2015)\nor data like the atom weight of He:\natom(He;weight)\nor the surface area of Neptune:\nplanet(Neptune; area)\nor use powerful functions:\nintegrate(6x² + 3x + 6)\nsolve(6x² +  6 = 12)\nand much more...\n
